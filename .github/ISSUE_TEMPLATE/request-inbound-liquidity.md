Where can we find your store?

How much more liquidity would be useful? (Don't say infinity, that doesn't help!)

What's your URI so the liquidity provider can connect? (pubkey@ip:9735) or (pubkey@toraddress:9735)

What is a good way for a routing node runner to contact you directly (optional)?

Anything else you'd like us to know?

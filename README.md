# merchants-looking-for-inbound
Do you need inbound liquidity on your lightning node? Are you a merchant or service? 
___________________________
Create a new issue and answer the following questions:

Where can we find your store?

How much more liquidity would be useful? (Don't say infinity, that doesn't help!)

What's your pubkey + onion address (URI) or amboss.space link?

Anything else you'd like us to know?

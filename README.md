# merchants-looking-for-inbound
Are you a merchant or service provider looking for inbound liquidity for your lightning node? 
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Simply create a new issue and answer the following questions:

Where can we find your store?

How much more liquidity would be useful? (Don't say infinity, that doesn't help!)

What's your URI so the liquidity provider can connect? ((pubkey@ip:9735) or (pubkey@toraddress:9735) or your amboss.space link)

What is a good way for a routing node runner to contact you directly (optional)?

Anything else you'd like us to know?

____________________________________________________________________________________________
After you do this, you can share on social media to grab the attention of lightning routing node runners who will likely want to open a channel with you in order to earn fee income.
